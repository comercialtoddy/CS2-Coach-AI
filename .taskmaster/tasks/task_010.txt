# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Core Data Retrieval Tools
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Successfully implemented and integrated the core data retrieval tools for GSI, Tracker.GG, and the local database. These tools are now fully operational and exposed via a REST API, providing real-time game analysis, historical performance tracking, and player profile management capabilities for the AI coaching system.
# Details:
The implementation delivered a robust, enterprise-grade architecture for data retrieval, unlocking significant capabilities for the AI system.

### Implemented Tools & Architecture:
- **Tool Classes**: `GetGSIInfoTool`, `GetTrackerGGStatsTool`, and `UpdatePlayerProfileTool` have been created in `src/electron/server/ai/tools/`.
- **AI Framework Integration**: All tools implement the `ITool<TInput, TOutput>` interface and are automatically registered with the `ToolManager` singleton on startup.
- **REST API Layer**: A `DataRetrievalController` exposes all tool functionality through 6 comprehensive REST endpoints with OpenAPI-ready documentation and validation.
- **Data Integration**: The system features direct integration with the live CS:GO GSI feed, the Tracker.GG API (with rate limiting and caching), and the local SQLite player database.

### Key Capabilities & Endpoints:
- **Real-time Game Analysis**: Access 11+ GSI data points (player state, map info, etc.) via `/data-retrieval/gsi`.
- **Historical Performance Tracking**: Retrieve 40+ player stat types from Tracker.GG via `/data-retrieval/tracker-stats`.
- **Player Profile Management**: Perform batch create/update operations on player profiles, supporting 8 distinct roles, via `/data-retrieval/update-profiles`.
- **System Monitoring**: System health and tool status are available through `/data-retrieval/status` and `/data-retrieval/tools/info`.

# Test Strategy:
The implementation was validated through comprehensive unit and integration tests covering each tool and the API layer. A dedicated REST endpoint, `/data-retrieval/test`, has been established for ongoing automated integration testing and health verification. System reliability is ensured through built-in health checks for all tools, which are monitored via the `/data-retrieval/status` endpoint.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Data Models and Tool Interfaces [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and define the input/output schemas and data structures for `Tool_GetGSIInfo` (GSI data), `Tool_GetTrackerGGStats` (Tracker.GG player stats), and `Tool_UpdatePlayerProfile` (local player profile data). This includes specifying data types, validation rules, and error handling conventions for each tool's interaction.
### Details:
This foundational step ensures consistency and clarity for subsequent implementation phases.

## 2. Implement Tool_GetGSIInfo Logic and Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop the core logic for `Tool_GetGSIInfo`. This involves establishing a connection to the GSI (Game State Integration) source, parsing real-time game data, and mapping it to the defined GSI data model. Implement robust error handling for connection issues, malformed data, and missing information.
### Details:
Focus on efficient data retrieval and reliable parsing of dynamic game state information.

## 3. Implement Tool_GetTrackerGGStats Logic and Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop the core logic for `Tool_GetTrackerGGStats`. This includes integrating with the Tracker.GG API, handling API key management, constructing requests for player statistics, and parsing the JSON responses into the defined Tracker.GG stats model. Implement rate limiting, retry mechanisms, and comprehensive error handling for API failures.
### Details:
Ensure adherence to Tracker.GG API usage policies and efficient data retrieval.

## 4. Implement Tool_UpdatePlayerProfile Logic and Database Interaction [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop the core logic for `Tool_UpdatePlayerProfile`. This involves implementing secure and efficient read/write operations with the local database for player profiles. Ensure data validation, concurrency control, and robust error handling for database operations (e.g., connection errors, data integrity violations).
### Details:
Focus on data persistence, integrity, and efficient database interactions.

## 5. Integrate Tools into System and Conduct Comprehensive Testing [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Integrate `Tool_GetGSIInfo`, `Tool_GetTrackerGGStats`, and `Tool_UpdatePlayerProfile` into the main system (e.g., an AI agent's tool registry or core application logic). Develop and execute comprehensive unit tests for each tool's functionality and integration tests to verify seamless data flow, correct behavior, and error handling across the entire system.
### Details:
This final step ensures all tools work together as expected and meet performance and reliability requirements.
