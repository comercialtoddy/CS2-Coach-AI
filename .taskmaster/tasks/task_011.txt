# Task ID: 11
# Title: Piper TTS Integration for Audio Generation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Piper TTS into the backend to convert textual feedback from the AI agent into high-quality, natural-sounding audio for in-game playback.
# Details:
Download pre-trained Piper TTS models (e.g., for Portuguese) and configure the backend to execute Piper as a child process (`child_process.spawn` or `exec`). The tool should take text as input and output an audio file (e.g., WAV or MP3). Implement error handling for Piper process failures. Ensure low latency for real-time feedback. Recommended: Piper TTS v1.2.0.

# Test Strategy:
Provide a sample text string to the Piper TTS integration. Verify that an audio file is generated correctly and that its quality is acceptable. Measure the conversion latency.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Download Piper TTS Models and Executable [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Acquire the necessary Piper TTS executable for the target operating system and download the desired voice models (e.g., en_US-ryan-medium.onnx) to a designated project directory.
### Details:
Identify the correct Piper TTS release for the deployment environment (Windows, Linux, macOS). Download the executable and place it in a known location. Select and download the required voice model files (.onnx and .json) and store them alongside or in a dedicated 'models' subdirectory.
<info added on 2025-07-06T15:43:40.960Z>
Official repository: rhasspy/piper (latest: 2023.11.14-2). Voice models are available at Hugging Face rhasspy/piper-voices in .onnx (model) and .onnx.json (config) formats. Portuguese support (pt_BR and pt_PT) is available in quality levels from x_low to high (16-22kHz). Integration will be handled via a child process with stdin/stdout streams. The implementation plan is to create an assets/piper directory, download the Windows binary executable, and download the medium quality pt_BR Portuguese voice models for configuration.

## 2. Configure Piper TTS Executable Path and Environment [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Set up the application to correctly locate the Piper TTS executable and model files, ensuring the environment is ready for execution.
### Details:
Implement configuration variables or environment settings to store the absolute or relative path to the Piper TTS executable and the directory containing the voice models. Verify that the application can access these paths.
<info added on 2025-07-06T15:49:30.480Z>
Configuration environment implemented:

Completed:

- Implemented automatic directory creation for assets/piper and models
- Added cross-platform executable path detection (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- Created model discovery and management system
- Implemented environment validation with ensurePiperExecutable() and ensureVoiceModels()

Implementation Details:
- Service automatically creates required directories: assets/piper/ and assets/piper/models/
- Executable path: assets/piper/piper/piper.exe (Windows) or piper (Unix)
- Models path: assets/piper/models/ for .onnx and .onnx.json files
- Environment validation during initialization

## 3. Implement Child Process Spawning for Piper TTS [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Develop the functionality to spawn Piper TTS as a child process, allowing the main application to control its execution.
### Details:
Use the appropriate programming language features (e.g., Python's `subprocess` module, Node.js `child_process`) to create a new process for Piper TTS. Configure the command-line arguments to specify the model path and other initial settings.
<info added on 2025-07-06T15:50:33.548Z>
Implemented child process spawning using Node.js `child_process.spawn()`. Created `textToSpeech()` and `textToSpeechFile()` methods with full process lifecycle management, including cleanup in a `dispose()` method and automatic termination with SIGTERM. The implementation features robust command-line argument construction for options like --model, --output-raw, and --speaker. It also includes proper stdio piping, error handling for spawn failures and process exits, exit code validation, and cross-platform executable path resolution. The functionality is robust and complete.

## 4. Develop Text-to-Audio Input/Output Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Implement the mechanism to send text input to the Piper TTS child process and capture the generated audio output (e.g., WAV or raw PCM data) from its standard output.
### Details:
Configure the child process to use pipes for `stdin` (for text input) and `stdout` (for audio output). Write text data to Piper's `stdin` and read the resulting audio bytes from its `stdout` in a continuous or buffered manner.
<info added on 2025-07-06T15:51:06.648Z>
Text-to-Audio Input/Output handling fully implemented:

Input Handling:
- Text input via piperProcess.stdin.write(text) + piperProcess.stdin.end()
- Proper text encoding and transmission to Piper process
- Support for variable text lengths with validation

Output Handling:
- Real-time audio data capture via piperProcess.stdout.on('data')
- Audio buffer accumulation: chunks.push(chunk) â†’ Buffer.concat(chunks)
- Support for both raw PCM output (--output-raw) and WAV files (--output_file)
- Streaming capability for real-time applications

Audio Format Support:
- Raw PCM stream capture for immediate processing
- WAV file generation for persistent storage
- Configurable sample rates (22050Hz for medium quality)
- Mono channel audio output

Process Communication:
- Bidirectional pipe communication: stdin for text, stdout for audio
- stderr monitoring for error/debug information
- Proper pipe closure and cleanup handling

Implementation Methods:
- textToSpeech(): Returns audio Buffer for in-memory processing
- textToSpeechFile(): Saves audio directly to file
- stream(): Chunks audio for real-time streaming

Input/Output handling is complete and optimized for low-latency applications.
