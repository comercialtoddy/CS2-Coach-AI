# Task ID: 25
# Title: Player Performance Dashboard (Web UI)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 5, 8, 18, 22, 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the comprehensive web-based performance dashboard (accessible within Electron) for players to review their stats, match history, and agent settings.
# Details:
Build a React application for the dashboard. Implement routes for 'Overview', 'Map Analysis', 'Weapon Analysis', 'Match History', and 'Settings'. Fetch data from the SQLite3 database (player profiles, match history, summaries, task progress) via backend API endpoints. Allow users to configure agent preferences (e.g., audio volume, voice, OpenRouter model selection). Use charting libraries like `Recharts` or `Chart.js` for data visualization.

# Test Strategy:
Populate the database with sample player data and match history. Navigate through all dashboard sections and verify that data is displayed correctly and charts render as expected. Test saving and loading agent settings.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize React Application & Core Layout [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the React project using Create React App or Vite, configure basic project structure, and establish the main dashboard layout (e.g., header, sidebar, main content area).
### Details:
This includes setting up ESLint, Prettier, and basic CSS/styling framework if applicable.

## 2. Implement Client-Side Routing [done]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Integrate React Router DOM to manage navigation between different sections of the dashboard (e.g., Player Overview, Detailed Stats, Agent Settings).
### Details:
Define routes for each major dashboard section and create placeholder components for each route.

## 3. Develop API Integration Layer [done]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Create services or custom hooks responsible for fetching player performance data and agent settings from the backend API. Define data structures and handle API responses.
### Details:
Implement Axios or Fetch API calls, handle authentication tokens if required, and define data models for player stats and agent configurations.

## 4. Design & Implement Data Visualization Components [done]
### Dependencies: 25.3
### Description: Utilize a charting library (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts, Nivo) to create interactive graphs and charts for displaying various player performance metrics.
### Details:
Develop reusable chart components for different data types (e.g., line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons, pie charts for distributions).

## 5. Build Player Performance Dashboard Sections [done]
### Dependencies: 25.2, 25.4
### Description: Develop the UI for the main dashboard views (e.g., 'Player Overview', 'Detailed Stats') by integrating fetched data with the designed data visualization components.
### Details:
Populate dashboard sections with actual player data, ensuring responsiveness and user-friendly layouts.

## 6. Implement Agent Settings UI [done]
### Dependencies: 25.2, 25.3
### Description: Create the user interface for managing agent-specific configurations and preferences, including input forms, validation, and integration with the API for saving settings.
### Details:
Develop forms for updating agent profile, notification preferences, or data display options. Ensure data persistence via API calls.

## 7. Implement Global State Management, Error Handling & Loading States [done]
### Dependencies: 25.3, 25.5, 25.6
### Description: Set up a state management solution (e.g., Redux, Context API, Zustand) for global application state, and implement robust error handling and loading indicators across all data-driven components.
### Details:
Centralize data fetching states, display appropriate loading spinners during API calls, and show user-friendly error messages for failed requests.
