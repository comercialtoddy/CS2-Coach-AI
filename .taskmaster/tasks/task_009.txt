# Task ID: 9
# Title: Core AI Tooling Framework Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the existing AI tooling framework to be enterprise-grade. This involves implementing advanced features for monitoring, extensibility, and robustness, transforming the initial implementation into a production-ready system.
# Details:
Building upon the initial implementation, this update will introduce several enterprise-grade features:
- A singleton `ToolManager` for global, consistent access.
- An event system for real-time monitoring of tool execution, coupled with statistics and health checks.
- Advanced extensibility helpers for rapid tool creation, a category system for organization, and automatic input validation.
- Robust execution control, including configurable timeouts and retry logic with exponential backoff.
- Enterprise-level standards: structured logging, standardized error codes, thread-safety considerations, and proper resource cleanup.

# Test Strategy:
Expand the existing test suite to be comprehensive. Create a new `AIToolingTest` suite covering various test scenarios, including success cases, failure cases, timeout handling, retry logic, and event emission. A new `PlayerDataTool` will be created as a reference implementation and must be fully tested. The test suite should validate all new enterprise features, including logging output, error codes, and health monitoring endpoints.

# Subtasks:
## 5. Refactor ToolManager and Implement Core Enterprise Features [done]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Refactor the ToolManager to use a singleton pattern for global access. Implement structured logging, standardized error codes, and basic thread-safety mechanisms to ensure production readiness.
### Details:
This will form the foundation of the enterprise-grade framework, ensuring stability and maintainability.

## 6. Implement Advanced Execution Control Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.5
### Description: Enhance the tool execution mechanism to support configurable timeouts and a retry policy with exponential backoff. This will improve the resilience of tool calls to transient failures.
### Details:
The retry logic should be configurable per tool or globally.

## 7. Develop Monitoring and Health Check System [done]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Implement an event system (e.g., event listeners) to emit hooks for the tool execution lifecycle. Add functionality to track execution statistics and expose a health check endpoint for the tooling framework.
### Details:
Events should include onStart, onSuccess, onFailure. Statistics should track call counts, latency, and error rates.

## 8. Improve Framework Extensibility [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.4
### Description: Create helper functions to simplify and accelerate the creation of new tools. Implement a category system within the ToolManager to allow for better organization and discovery of tools.
### Details:
Helpers should abstract away boilerplate code. The category system should allow listing tools by category.

## 9. Create Comprehensive Documentation and Reference Tool [done]
### Dependencies: 9.8
### Description: Write a detailed README.md covering the new enterprise features, best practices, and usage examples. Implement a `PlayerDataTool` as a complete, well-documented reference example for developers.
### Details:
The documentation should be the single source of truth for using the new framework.

## 10. Expand Test Suite for Enterprise-Grade Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 9.6, 9.7, 9.9
### Description: Develop a new, comprehensive test suite (`AIToolingTest`) that validates all the new features. This includes tests for the singleton pattern, logging, error codes, timeouts, retry logic, event listeners, and the reference `PlayerDataTool`.
### Details:
The test suite should aim for high coverage of all new enterprise functionalities.

## 1. Define Common Tool Interface (ITool) [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and document the core interface (e.g., ITool) that all AI tools must implement. This includes methods for tool name, description, input schema, and execution logic. Focus on clarity, simplicity, and future compatibility.
### Details:
This interface will serve as the contract for all tools integrated into the AI system.

## 2. Implement ToolManager for Tool Registration [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop the ToolManager class responsible for registering instances of ITool. This includes methods to add, retrieve, and list available tools, ensuring thread-safe operations and preventing duplicate registrations.
### Details:
The registration mechanism will allow the AI to discover and manage its available tools.

## 3. Implement ToolManager for Tool Dispatch/Execution [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Extend the ToolManager to include functionality for dispatching tool execution based on tool name and provided arguments. This involves validating inputs against the tool's schema and handling the execution of the tool's logic.
### Details:
This component will be responsible for invoking the correct tool with the correct parameters.

## 4. Design for Extensibility and Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Review the framework design to ensure it supports easy addition of new tool types, versioning, and robust error handling mechanisms (e.g., for invalid tool calls, execution failures). Document guidelines for extending the framework.
### Details:
Future-proofing the framework and ensuring its reliability are critical for long-term maintainability.
