# Task ID: 21
# Title: Auto-Correction Engine Logic
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 17, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the auto-correction engine, enabling the AI agent to monitor the effectiveness of its own suggestions and adapt its coaching approach over time.
# Details:
Implement a feedback loop mechanism. After a suggestion is given, the agent will monitor subsequent GSI data and player actions to infer if the suggestion was followed and if it led to a positive outcome. Store this feedback in the `InteractionHistory` (Memory Module). Use this data to adjust future `Tool_GenerateSuggestion` calls, potentially using reinforcement learning principles or simple heuristic adjustments based on success/failure rates.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate a scenario where a suggestion is given. Then, simulate player actions that either follow or ignore the suggestion, and lead to positive or negative outcomes. Verify that the auto-correction engine correctly updates its internal models or memory based on these outcomes.

# Subtasks:
